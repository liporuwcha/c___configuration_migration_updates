## c___ configuration, migration, update

Every project evolves and the code and the database need to be updated. Sometimes it is called "migration". Living with a database is very dynamic. Much more than just living with a program.

The same database can contain more than one project coded by different teams. The order of changes must not be linear. It means, that the team must know what projects are exclusively theirs and what projects are common and must be coordinated with other teams.
When writing the code it must be always careful, that it does not break when a new field is added.

To achieve integrity of the database all the code is concentrated inside the database. So other parts of the project can use common code.

### ca__ database objects

- caa_ postgres server utils
- cab_ postgres database utils
- cat_ tables
- caf_ fields
- cav_ view
- cap_ procedures  

### cj__ migration

how to migrate every table separately. Ideally without server downtime.

### cs__ backup and restore

### ct__ development, testing and production environment

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).
